User Story:
  One very underrepresented group of people in First Person Shooters is the handicap community. We need a game that incorporates FPS features while showing what it is like for a person in a wheel chair. This means that the character would be unable to do this that a person with the ability to walk could. For example someone in a wheel chair would be unable to use stairs, forcing them to find ramps and/or elevators to get to the desired location. The game should still be entertaining and provide a twist to your typical FPS.
