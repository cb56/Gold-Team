Project Description:

  This project will be a first person shooter where the players and enemys will be in wheel chairs. This will effect how the environment is layed out, how they interact with the environment and how they use their weapons. Players will only be able to use a pistol when moving and bigger guns when they are not since these will require both hands to be free. Players will be able to aquire new guns through varirous means. The project will consist of 2 game modes Deathmatch where the players are placed into teams and Free For All where it is every man for himself. It will include both single and multiplayer. It will be done using Unity and C# as well as Blender for graphics.

MVP:
Our MVP will include the following:

 - A Lobbying System that allows players to choose a game or be randomly placed into one. 
 -  A UI that players can view there current inventory(in game) and choose game modes.
 - An AI that will be behave like other players.
 - An iteractive envionment with ramps, power ups(boosts), elevators and traps.
 - Two different Game Modes: DeathMatch and FFA.
 - Realistic wheel chair mechcanics (ie. Players will not be able to use stairs).
 - Players will only be able to use a pistol when moving and will need to be stoped to use better guns.
 - A variety of guns with different benefits.
 - An inventory of weapons obtained throughout the game.
 - Finite Hit Points that can be replenshied by pickuping up certain consumables found throughout the game.

 

Add-on Features:

  1. Leveling/Experiance System
  
  2. Classes/Loadout System

  3. Multiple and dynamicaly generated maps
  
User Story:
  One very underrepresented group of people in First Person Shooters is the handicap community. We need a game that incorporates FPS features while showing what it is like for a person in a wheel chair. This means that the character would be unable to do things that a person with the ability to walk could. For example someone in a wheel chair would be unable to use stairs, forcing them to find ramps and/or elevators to get to the desired location. The game should still be entertaining and provide a twist to your typical FPS.

Team Roles:

  Josh joshuaem: Movement, Environmental interactions. This includes gun placement magnement of elevators, boosts, traps and other tasks involing the character and the environment. Josh will handle how the map is layed out and how the player/AI will interact with the obstacles.
  
  Matt mjholder:  Matt will be in charge of the multiplayer aspects of the game this incudes Networking, Multiplayer, PVP, Matchmaking, and Player Synchronization.
  
  Ryan rdsandid: Graphics/Assest Gathering/ AI (PVM)/ Gun mechanics. Ryan's role will focus mostly on the character it self. How they look how and how they fight. He will handle the Gun mechanics and fighting system. This will then be applied to the AI controlled enemys in the game.
